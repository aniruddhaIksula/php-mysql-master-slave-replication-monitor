= Actions: Minimal Response =
== Test ==
This preforms a test (status and row replication testing) and returns the status: "Success" or "Failure"
`..../replication-monitor/?action=Test`
== Test & Heal ==
This preforms a test (status and row replication testing) and returns "Success" if successful.  If the test fails, it then attempts to automatically "Heal" by restarting the replication (see *Restart Slave*).  It will then test again and return the status: "Success" or "Failure"
`..../replication-monitor/?action=TestAndHeal`


Test Test & Heal Restart Slave Skip Start Slave Break Replication (destructive) Rebuild Slave (destructive) 




== Restart Slave ==
This action will restart the Slave server
{{{
STOP SLAVE;
RESET SLAVE;
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='$file', MASTER_LOG_POS=$pos;
START SLAVE;
}}}
And then it will test status again, by preforming a "Skip Start Slave" action.

== Skip Start Slave ==
Sometimes there's a conflict when replicating content from the Master to the Slave (perhaps someone wrote a record to the slave?).  This action will attempt to skip the record and start replication again... it loops 10 times, attempting.
{{{
SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER=1;
START SLAVE;
START SLAVE IO_THREAD;
START SLAVE SQL_THREAD;
}}}
This results in a status message, testing after the start.

== Load Data From Master ==
This is a manual link, which can load data from the master.
WARNING: this can be really slow and lock up the server while running.
{{{
LOAD DATA FROM MASTER;
}}}
